# Machine Learning problem

Written in Python 3 using Google Colab!

I was tasked to complete this project as an introduction to machine learning.

In this project, i learned how to extract, organize, fine-tune, and get insights of big data using libraries like pandas, sklearn, and matlpotlib.
I also understood key concepts in machine learning such as regression types, unsupervised learning, confusion matrix, and ways of minimizing overfitting.
The goal of this project was to fine-tune a given labeled dataset in order to train a model to predict a binary output.
At the end of the project, the model achieved an accuracy of 83%. The duration of this project was 1 week, and i had to learn all these concepts from scratch.
